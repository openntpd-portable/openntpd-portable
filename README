NetBSD port of OpenNTPD.

It seems to looks fine at my NetBSD environment.

I think there is probably mistakes, so I want someone to check and correct.




Original README, See below.

This is a new port of OpenBSD's native ntpd to other Unix flavours adding
autoconf support and the necessary compatibility layer.  It is based on
portability code from the OpenSSH and LibreSSL portable projects.

OpenNTPD has a web site at http://www.openntpd.org/

The current portable tree can be found at https://github.com/openntpd-portable

Platform Requirements
---------------------
 - adjtime(2) and settimeofday(2) syscalls or equivalent.
 - adjfreq(2) or an equivalent compatibility function for best results
 - daemon(3), setresgid(2), setresuid(2) or equivalent
 - A working arc4random(2) implementation, OpenSSL or LibreSSL
     (this project shares the same arc4random compatibility code from LibreSSL)

At the time of writing the Portable version is known to build and work on:

 - OpenBSD (5.6)
 - Linux (Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04)
 - FreeBSD (9.x, 10.x)
 - Solaris (10.x, 11.x)
 - Mac OS X (10.9)

OpenNTPD may work on other operating systems, newer and older, but the above
ones are tested regularly by the developer.

Reports (success or otherwise) are welcome. You may report bugs or submit pull
requests at the GitHub project: https://github.com/openntpd-portable

Thanks,
